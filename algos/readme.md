Sure, here's a brief overview of how the `PPO`, `RolloutStorage`, and `ACAgent` classes from the [`algos`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%22algos%22%5D "algos") module work together:

## [`PPO`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolInFile?%5B%22algos%2Fppo.py%22%2C%22PPO%22%5D "algos/ppo.py")

The `PPO` class implements the Proximal Policy Optimization algorithm, a type of reinforcement learning algorithm. It's initialized with an actor-critic model, various hyperparameters, and an optimizer for updating the model's parameters.

Key methods include:

- `__init__`: Initializes the PPO instance with the actor-critic model and hyperparameters.
- `update`: Updates the actor-critic model using the rollout data.

## [`RolloutStorage`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolInFile?%5B%22algos%2Fstorage.py%22%2C%22RolloutStorage%22%5D "algos/storage.py")

The `RolloutStorage` class is used to store the data collected during the rollout of the policy in the environment. This data is then used to update the policy.

Key methods include:

- `__init__`: Initializes the RolloutStorage instance with the given parameters.
- `insert`: Inserts the collected data into the storage.
- `after_update`: Resets the storage after each update.

## [`ACAgent`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolInFile?%5B%22algos%2Fagent.py%22%2C%22ACAgent%22%5D "algos/agent.py")

The `ACAgent` class represents an agent that uses an actor-critic model to interact with the environment. It's initialized with a `PPO` instance and a `RolloutStorage` instance.

Key methods include:

- `__init__`: Initializes the ACAgent instance with the PPO and RolloutStorage instances.
- `update`: Calls the `update` method of the PPO instance to update the actor-critic model.
- `act`: Uses the actor-critic model to select an action given the current state.
- `insert`: Inserts the collected data into the RolloutStorage instance.
- `train` and `eval`: Switch the actor-critic model between training and evaluation mode.

In summary, the `ACAgent` uses the `PPO` to update its actor-critic model and the `RolloutStorage` to store the data collected during the rollout. The `PPO` uses the data in the `RolloutStorage` to update the actor-critic model.
